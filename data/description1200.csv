00","YOUR TICKET TO A LEGENDARY COLORWAY: It’s been decades since a certain Austrian ticket company commissioned a unique keyboard for its internal operations. Years after these original keyboards were retired, the iconic colorway persisted, returning several times in one-off keycap set releases.
CLASSIC COLORWAY: Now, it’s back again with the Drop MT3 Skiidata Keycap Set. Sporting the classically inspired orange-on-dark-gray colorway using high quality doubleshot ABS and sculpted in our exclusive, scooped MT3 profile and for an ultra-satisfying feel.
FROM THE IBM TERMINAL TO THE DESKTOP: Based on the profile form the iconic IBM beamspring terminals of the 1970s, this custom set is fully sculpted in Hi-Profile. From its heavily slanted design to the scooped, contoured tops of each cap, the set recreates the feel of vintage keyboards.
DOUBLESHOT ABS LEGENDS: As opposed to a dye-sublimiation process, these doubleshot legends are permanently molded inside the keycap, thus becoming an integral part of it. This ensures reliable legends and continuity throughout the set.
ORTHOLINEAR: For ortho keyboards like the Drop Planck, Preonic, and other boards with similar layouts."
