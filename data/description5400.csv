PROTECTION: It’s normal not to want to walk barefoot in a shower or lounge at the pool which thousands of people have already used. After so much use, it can be common for certain fungal germs to develop and infect you with warts or athlete's foot.
COMFORTABLE INSOLES: An outdoor shoe that doesn’t do a number on your feet after only a couple of hours. Our lightweight sandals are made with a soft but durable insole that feels like you’re laying your foot on a bed made of thin memory foam.
OPEN-TOE, SLIP-ON SANDALS: Our sandals come in a variety of sizes that can fit adolescent boys and older men. Simply slide them on and go about your day without worrying about them slipping off or coming loose.
QUALITY MATERIALS: Unlike cheap pool and shower shoes that wear and tear after a couple of months, our sandals are made with high-quality materials that last much longer. We make the sole out of hard, waterproof rubber for extra comfort.
ADAPTIVE FOOTWEAR: Use our sandals at the pool, in a public shower, at the gym, or even for just walking around the block. Wherever your life’s journey takes you, you'll know that you're sandals can provide you with the best comfort and protection."
