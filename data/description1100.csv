FROM THE IBM TERMINAL TO THE DESKTOP: Based on the profile form the iconic IBM beamspring terminals of the 1970s, this custom set is fully sculpted in Hi-Profile. From its heavily slanted design to the scooped, contoured tops of each cap, the set recreates the feel of vintage keyboards.
DOUBLESHOT LEGENDS: As opposed to a dye-sublimiation process, these doubleshot legends are permanently molded inside the keycap, thus becoming an integral part of it. This ensures reliable legends and continuity throughout the set.
BASE KIT: Covers fullsize, tenkeyless, winkeyless, 60%, 65%, and 75% Mechanical keyboards such as the Drop ALT, Carina, ENTR, and CTRL.
SPECS: Produced by Drop, designed by zslane, ABS Hi-Profile MT3 keycaps, Doubleshot legends, MX compatible, and fully sculpted based on IBM beamspring keycaps."

With surplus style to match its imposing size, this Cherry-manufactured board was all but begging for a keycap set to be made in its honor.
INTRODUCING MT3 9009: a throwback with timeless character and top-notch build quality. Paying homage to the original’s classic color scheme, this off-white-and-gray set is accented with small touches of light green and red for a look that’s both retro and refreshing.
MT3 PROFILE: Shaped in our scooped, slanted MT3 profile for a feel that’s both vintage and modern, MT3 9009 is available in a wide range of kits—including a special Novelties Kit with legends from the original board.
DYE-SUBLIMATED PBT: Durable, dye-sublimated PBT build ensures lasting brilliance with an exceptional feel.
ARES BASE KIT: This 128 key kit offers coverage for most popular keyboards, including HHKB, 60%, 65%, 75%, TKL, WKL, including ISO layouts. Add the optional numpad kit for 96-key, full-size, and 1800 layout support."

FROM THE IBM TERMINAL TO THE DESKTOP: Based on the profile form the iconic IBM beamspring terminals of the 1970s, this custom set is fully sculpted in Hi-Profile. From its heavily slanted design to the scooped, contoured tops of each cap, the set recreates the feel of vintage keyboards.
DOUBLESHOT LEGENDS: As opposed to a dye-sublimiation process, these doubleshot legends are permanently molded inside the keycap, thus becoming an integral part of it. This ensures reliable legends and continuity throughout the set.
BASE KIT: Covers fullsize, tenkeyless, winkeyless, 60%, 65%, and 75% Mechanical keyboards such as the Drop ALT, Carina, ENTR, CTRL, and SHIFT.
SPECS: Produced by Drop, ABS Hi-Profile MT3 keycaps, Doubleshot legends, MX compatible, and fully sculpted based on IBM beamspring keycaps."

Where neon lights leave false reflections, and AI machines leave humans playing catch-up, it’s every man, woman, and robot for themselves.
Designed by MiTo, MT3 Cyber pairs raw purple keys with searing pink, yellow, and green legends for a digital look to upgrade any board in need of implants. The seemingly chaotic colorway is a nod to the cyberpunk genre and the real-life constraints of MT3 tooling.
FROM THE IBM TERMINAL TO THE DESKTOP: Based on the profile form the iconic IBM beamspring terminals of the 1970s, this custom set is fully sculpted in Hi-Profile. From its heavily slanted design to the scooped, contoured tops of each cap, the set recreates the feel of vintage keyboards.
DOUBLESHOT LEGENDS: As opposed to a dye-sublimiation process, these doubleshot legends are permanently molded inside the keycap, thus becoming an integral part of it. This ensures reliable legends and continuity throughout the set.
BASE KIT: Covers HHKB, 60%, 65%, and TKL Keyboards. Add a Numpad Kit for full-size and 1800 layouts."

On the officially licensed Drop + The Lord of the Rings MT3 Dwarvish Keycap Set, we’re bringing their look and language to your keyboard.
CIRTH: The Dwarves spoke Khuzdul, a secret language which they transcribed into the Elvish script Cirth. When the Elves went on to adopt other forms of writing, Cirth became known as the written word of Dwarves and the official text of this keycap set.
DESIGNED BY Matt3o: In an earthy-gray-and-off-white colorway, its runelike legends are faithful translations of corresponding Khuzdul terms and Cirth characters—and its durable, dye-sublimated PBT build ensures lasting brilliance with an exceptional feel.
DYE-SUBLIMATED PBT: Durable, dye-sublimated PBT build ensures lasting brilliance with an exceptional feel.
DWARVISH BASE KIT: It covers standard 60% through TKL layouts and will work as a base for full-size layouts. There are also alternative modifiers for enthusiast layouts like HHKB, Winkeyless, 65%, 75% layouts. Finally, the set also contains an ISO enter key and other keys for ISO layouts."

ALUMINUM SWITH PLATE: The most common material found in custom keyboard kits, aluminum offers a good balance of stiffness and flexibility to complement most switches.
BRASS SWITCH PLATE: With a higher stiffness rating than aluminum, it provides an even sturdier feel.
COPPER SWITCH PLATE: Similar to brass in its chemical makeup, copper provides a rigid, satisfying feel.
