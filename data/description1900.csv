This milestone, born from years of relentless innovation, changes the shape of visual display and pioneers the future of monitor technology.※ 'R' is an acronym representing circular radius. The smaller the 'R' value, the deeper the curve.
1000R AND EYE COMFORT CERTIFICATION: T55 received a high performance curved display (1000R) and eye comfort certificate for its superior 1000R curved display from TÜV Rheinland; a leading international Testing , Inspection, and Certification body.※ Eye comfort certificate only applies to 24-inch and 27-inch monitors.
READY TO ENTERTAIN: Connect to all your favorite devices with a convenient HDMI, DP, and D-Sub triple interface. The built-in 5 Watt speakers make it even easier to get lost in your favorite movies or TV shows, without plugging in a speaker.
THE CURVE CHAMPION: The leader in curved monitors. Samsung has led the curved monitor market since being the first to introduce the innovative displays to the world in 2015. With industry-leading technology in a full line-up, Samsung's curved monitors are consistently number one in market share.※ Based on data from IDC Quarterly PC Monitor Tracker 2019, Q3
MINIMALIST DESIGN: Next-generation design. The virtually borderless display's striking aesthetic is enhanced by a fabric-textured backside and premium-quality slim metal stand. The result is a monitor that won't just catch eyes, but complements any interior, too."
