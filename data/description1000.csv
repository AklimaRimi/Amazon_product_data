99","PLAY AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT – The first mechanical RGB gaming keyboard featuring exclusive ROG RX Red Optical Mechanical Switches. These switches provide a 100-million-keystroke lifespan and offer consistent linear keystrokes with immediate response. In addition, each switch has a central RGB LED to give every key all-round lighting.
ABOUT ROG RX SWITCH - ROG RX Red Optical Mechanical Switches are the first to be developed by ROG. Fine-tuned to have switches with a 1.5mm actuation point for lightning-fast inputs. Initial force of 40gf prevents accidental keystrokes, and goes all the way up to 55gf for perfect rebound feedback.
READY FOR WORK OR PLAY - Quick-Toggle Switch prepares ROG Strix Scope RX for gaming or the daily grind, toggling the top row between Media or Function (Fn) key input – so it's easy to switch modes for work or play. The keyboard is topped with an aluminum faceplate for everyday resilience, and finished with a striking slash aesthetic for a little touch of style.
BUILT TO LAST - ROG Strix Scope RX offers industry-leading IP57 waterproof and dust resistance, ensuring it’s well-protected from spills and dust. It also has a durable aluminum alloy top plate that provides structural rigidity to give you long-lasting and reliable performance.
CRAFTED FOR FPS GAMERS - After studying the play style of FPS gamers, the ROG R&D team created Xccurate Design: A Ctrl key that’s twice as wide as usual. In the heat of battle, the larger size makes it easy to quickly find and hit. Marked with an iconic cloaked-figure keycap, the Stealth key instantly hides all apps and mutes all audio, assuring instant privacy, whenever you need it. A simple tap engages it, and another tap brings apps and audio back up, as they were."
