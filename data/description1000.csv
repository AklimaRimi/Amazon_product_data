The most frightening keycap set to ever hit your city has emerged from the ocean depths—monstrous, unstoppable, and dripping wet. Taking inspiration from classic Japanese monster movies, GMK Kaiju is the latest from designer Nephlock, who you may know from the breakout GMK Metropolis.
KAIJU: In Japanese, “kaiju” translates to “strange beast,” which is fitting given the colors of the set. There’s green modifiers for a reptilian look, hot orange accents for a kaiju’s fiery breath, and beige alphas that pay homage to defense terminals used to coordinate retaliation. Finally, tying it all together are the hiragana Japanese sublegends.
DURABLE DOUBLESHOT ABS CONSTRUCTION: Made with ABS plastic with a semi-matte finish, the GMK Kaiju keycaps are doubleshot injected, which means the legends won’t fade over time. They’re also sculpted in German-designed Cherry profile, known for its comfortable feel for programmers, writers, and more. As far as compatibility, the keycaps will fit on Cherry MX stems and related clones.
MADE IN GERMANY: Using original Cherry tooling, the set comprises 150 ultra-thick, ultra-durable ABS keycaps that put PBT to the test.
BASE KIT COMPATIBILITY: This kit offers coverage for any standard-layout keyboard, as well as a variety of popular custom layouts, such as 1800, CP, WKL, TKL, 75%, 65%, 60%, and MX-HHKB style."

These switches provide a 100-million-keystroke lifespan and offer consistent linear keystrokes with immediate response. In addition, each switch has a central RGB LED to give every key all-round lighting.
ABOUT ROG RX SWITCH - ROG RX Red Optical Mechanical Switches are the first to be developed by ROG. Fine-tuned to have switches with a 1.5mm actuation point for lightning-fast inputs. Initial force of 40gf prevents accidental keystrokes, and goes all the way up to 55gf for perfect rebound feedback.
READY FOR WORK OR PLAY - Quick-Toggle Switch prepares ROG Strix Scope RX for gaming or the daily grind, toggling the top row between Media or Function (Fn) key input – so it's easy to switch modes for work or play. The keyboard is topped with an aluminum faceplate for everyday resilience, and finished with a striking slash aesthetic for a little touch of style.
BUILT TO LAST - ROG Strix Scope RX offers industry-leading IP57 waterproof and dust resistance, ensuring it’s well-protected from spills and dust. It also has a durable aluminum alloy top plate that provides structural rigidity to give you long-lasting and reliable performance.
CRAFTED FOR FPS GAMERS - After studying the play style of FPS gamers, the ROG R&D team created Xccurate Design: A Ctrl key that’s twice as wide as usual. In the heat of battle, the larger size makes it easy to quickly find and hit. Marked with an iconic cloaked-figure keycap, the Stealth key instantly hides all apps and mutes all audio, assuring instant privacy, whenever you need it. A simple tap engages it, and another tap brings apps and audio back up, as they were."

2 YEARS OF METICULOUS DEVELOPMENT: Taking over 2 years to refine our design, strengthen our manufacturing, and gather input from our community, we created a shorter, subtly sculpted keycap profile worthy of any endgame keyboard.
ABS KEYCAPS: DCX (Drop Cylindrical X) keycaps are made from ultra-substantial, proprietary ABS material that’s neither shiny nor hollow-sounding. For a truly blemish-free look that lasts, each keycap’s sprue mark is located on its interior.
DOUBLESHOT LEGENDS: Zoom in on the doubleshot legends, and you’ll find next to no flaws there either, since each one is injected within precise tolerances of 0.05 millimeters.
COMPATIBILITY: As far as compatibility, the keycaps will fit on Cherry MX stems and related clone and offers extensive layout support including HHKB, 60%, 65%, 75K TKL, WKL, Full-size, 1800, and more."
